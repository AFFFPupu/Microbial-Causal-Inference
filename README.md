# DPhil Chapter 4 Code and Simulations

This repository contains R and Julia code used for simulations and analyses in Chapter 4 of my DPhil thesis. The code involves modeling complex systems, including microbial dynamics, causal inference, and the analysis of graphical structures like Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) and Partially Ancestral Graphs (PAGs).

## How to Use

The code requires both **R** and **Julia** environments with several packages. Below is a summary of the major components of this repository.

### Key Components

- **Microbial Dynamics Simulation**: Implements simulations using Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) and Holling Type Functional models to represent microbial species interactions and population dynamics.
- **Causal Graph Inference**: Utilizes various methods to generate and analyze Directed Mixed Graphs (ADMGs) and Partially Ancestral Graphs (PAGs).
- **Julia Integration**: The `JuliaCall` package is used to interface R with Julia, allowing seamless execution of Julia code within the R environment.
